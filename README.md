So, you will find an "style.css" file I left that because I want to save it as a backup. since that file is too long I've used SCSS to take advantage of the fact that it can divide the code into modules.

in the index.html inside of the you will find the straight link to "style.css" commented out. feel free to switch among those styles links. it's gonna give you the same result.

Finally. Do not forget, if you are using VS-code, to download "live sass compiler" extension.
